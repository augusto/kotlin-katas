Kotlin Koans
===========

Kotlin Koans are a series of exercises to get you familiar with the Kotlin Syntax. 
Each exercise is created as a failing unit test and your job is to make it pass. 

Open up the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your favorite editor. 
Run 'All tests' and fix them.

The repository has two branches, master which contains the exercises for you to do and resolutions which contains the resolved exercises. 
Make sure you don’t cheat!
